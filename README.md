# Mount and Unmount EFI Partitions on macOS  
**EFI Control** is undergoing a complete rebuild from the ground up. Stay tuned for exciting updates as we enhance the app to improve functionality and design.

---

## Latest Updates

- The new **app interface** will be designed entirely in **SwiftUI**, ensuring a clean, macOS-native experience.
- **Command functionality** will probably be based on CorpNewt's [MountEFI](https://github.com/CorpNewt/MountEFI) script.
- Since MountEFI utilizes Python, **EFI Control** may require Python to function. If needed, we will provide a lightweight, user-friendly Python installation option.
- **Bugs and feedback** can be reported via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/macOSUtilities/EFIcontrol/issues) on our GitHub repository.
- All app windows will feature a sleek, translucent background—similar to Safari’s default background and the sidebars in many macOS system apps.
